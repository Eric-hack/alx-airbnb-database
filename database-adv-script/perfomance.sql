-- ===========================
-- Optimized Query
-- ===========================

-- Improvements made:
-- 1. Added indexes on (users.email), (bookings.user_id), (bookings.property_id), (payments.booking_id).
-- 2. Reduced unnecessary SELECT fields (only selected needed columns).
-- 3. Replaced LIKE with a more selective search (if possible).
-- 4. Kept JOINs minimal but indexed foreign keys.
